"""
This module will handle Blender rendering commands for CS:GO/CS2 demos.
To be implemented to work with the existing Blender implementation at C:\demofetch\blender.

Current Blender Structure (C:\demofetch\blender):
- core/: Core Blender functionality
  - animation.py: Animation handling
  - camera.py: Camera control
  - materials.py: Material management
  - player.py: Player model handling
  - scene.py: Scene management
  - textoverlay.py: Text overlay system
- sourcemodels/: Source engine models
  - maps/: CS2 map files (.nav, .obj, .vmdl_c)
  - playermodels/: Player model files
- scenes/: Blender scene files
- renders/: Output directory for rendered videos

Planned Integration:
1. Camera Path System
   - Integrate with existing camera.py
   - Support for current map models in sourcemodels/maps/
   - Work with existing scene setup in scenes/maps.blend

2. Scene Composition
   - Use existing scene.py functionality
   - Support current map collection
   - Integrate with material system from materials.py

3. Player Rendering
   - Use existing player.py implementation
   - Support current player models in sourcemodels/playermodels/
   - Integrate with animation system from animation.py

4. Text and Overlay System
   - Utilize existing textoverlay.py
   - Support current rendering configuration

5. Rendering Pipeline
   - Work with current render settings
   - Output to existing renders/ directory
   - Support current rendering workflow

Planned commands:
!blenderrender <demo_name> [options]
    - Will use existing Blender setup from C:\demofetch\blender
    - Integrate with current rendering pipeline
    - Support existing render settings

!blendercam <demo_name> [subcommand]
    - Will work with current camera.py implementation
    - Support existing map geometry
    - Integrate with current scene setup

!blenderscene <demo_name> [subcommand]
    - Will utilize current scene.py functionality
    - Work with existing material system
    - Support current map collection

Future implementation will integrate with:
1. Existing Blender Python scripts in core/
2. Current map and model system in sourcemodels/
3. Established rendering pipeline
4. Current scene configuration in scenes/maps.blend
